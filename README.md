## Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store
---
### Project Overview
---
The main purpose of the project is to  analyze the sales performance of a retail store and to uncover key insights such as top-selling products, regional performance, and monthly sales trends.By analyzing the various parameters in the data received, the goal is to gather sufficient insights to make reasonable decisions enabling me to tell compelling stories around the data. This analysis is centered around discovering the revenue trends, monthly sales trend, and customer behavior across the various regions and also aids in identifying the key performance indicators from the data so as to measure company growth.

### Data Sources
---
The primary source of the Data used is Sales performance Analysis data.xlxs. made available by LITA DATA ANALYSIS BOOTCAMP, an online training class.

### Data Collected
---
The data collected contains the following key columns needed for the analysis:
- Order ID: set of numbers given to identify each order
- Customer ID: Set of numbers to uniquely identify each customer making a purchase.
- Poduct: The commodity sold
- Region: specific geographical location where transaction is made
- OrderDate: date to which an order was made
- Quantity: number of product bought
- Unit Price: price per product
- Total Sales: purchase amount for each product
- Revenue: Purchase amount expressed in monetary terms.

### Objectives
---
This project was structured to address the following analysis goals:
- Total sales by product: determine the total sale by each product category
- Number of sales transaction by Region; determine the total number of sales coming from each region
- Revenue by product and region: determine the sum of revenue generated by each product category and region
- Percentage of total sale by region: determine the percentage of total sales contributed by each region
- Top Customers by total sales: determine the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.

### Key Metrics
---
Key metrics are quantifiable measurements relevant for tracking performance/progress and making informed decisions. The following metrics were used:
- Total Revenue: grouped by products and regions
- Total Sales Volume: grouped by number of sales transactions
- Product Sales Performance: total sales grouped by products
- Sales Growth Rate

### Tools used
---
1. Microsoft Excel 
- For data cleaning 
- For analysis
  
2. SQL Server
- For exploratory Data analysis
  
3. Power BI
- For Data Analysis and DAX
- For data visualization

### Data Cleaning and Prepaions
---
At the initial phase the following actions were performed:
- Data loading and Inspection
- Handling missing variables
- Handling duplicate rows and columns
- Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
This involved exploring the data to find certain answers to question such as:
- What is the total sale for each product category?
- What is the number of sales transactions in each region?
- What is the highest selling product by total sales value
- What is the total revenue per product?
- What are the monthly sales for the current year
- Find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount
- What is the percentage of total sales contributed by each region?
- What are the products with no sales in the last quarter?

### Formulas Used
---
These are formulas/ queries used for analysis and visualizations. These are Microsoft Excel, SQL Server and Power BI respectively:

```Microsoft Excel
Total sales = quantity sold * unit price
Revenue = total sales
```

```SQL
 SELECT SUM(Total_Sales) AS TotalSale, Product FROM [dbo].[SalesData 1]
GROUP BY Product

SELECT COUNT(Total_Sales) AS Number_of_Sales_Transaction, Region FROM [dbo].[SalesData 1]
GROUP BY Region

SELECT MAX(Total_Sales) AS Highest_selling, Product FROM [dbo].[SalesData 1]
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY 1 DESC

SELECT SUM(Revenue) AS Total_Revenue, Product FROM [dbo].[SalesData 1]
GROUP BY Product 
ORDER BY 1 DESC

SELECT MONTH(OrderDate) AS Month, SUM(Total_Sales) AS Total_Sale FROM [dbo].[SalesData 1]
WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = 2024
GROUP BY MONTH(OrderDate)
ORDER BY MONTH(OrderDate)

SELECT  TOP 5 Customer_Id, SUM(Total_Sales) AS Total_Purchase_Amount
FROM [dbo].[SalesData 1] 
GROUP BY Customer_Id
ORDER BY 2 DESC
 
SELECT
    Region, COUNT(*) AS Region_sales,
	(COUNT(*) * 100.0 /(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [dbo].[SalesData 1])) AS Sales_percentage
FROM [dbo].[SalesData 1]
GROUP BY Region

SELECT Product
FROM [dbo].[SalesData 1]
GROUP BY Product
HAVING MAX(OrderDate) < DATEADD(QUARTER, -1, GETDATE())
```

```Power BI
DateTable = CALENDAR(MIN(SalesData[OrderDate]), MAX(SalesData[OrderDate]))

Year = YEAR(DateTable[Date])

MonthlySalesCurrentYear =
    CALCULATE(
        [TotalPurchaseAmount],
       YEAR(SalesData[OrderDate]) = YEAR(TODAY()))

NoSalesLastQuarter =
    IF([SalesinLastQuarter] = 0, 1, 0)

Number of Transactions = COUNT(SalesData[Total sales])

SalesinLastQuarter = CALCULATE( SUM(SalesData[Total sales]), PREVIOUSQUARTER(DateTable[Date]))

Total Sales Percentage = DIVIDE(SUM(SalesData[Total sales]), CALCULATE(SUM(SalesData[Total sales]), ALL(SalesData[Region])))

TotalPurchaseAmount = SUM(SalesData[Total sales])
```

The socks product category experienced a decline in revenue generated in 2024 while the gloves and jacket had a slight increase in total revenue generation for the year 2024. 

B. Interpretation and Implications:
- From the data , the high performance in revenue generation by the shoe product category could be due to favorable market conditions and consumer choice and preferences. Poor performance of the shirt and socks product categories should be assessed to find out the cause of decline. This can be due to unfavorable market conditions such as  increased competitions, change in customer choice and preferences, and poor product quality of performance
- The need to focus on strategies that will boost sales is important. Strategies such as increasing product quality, effective branding and marketing efforts, and solving supply chains issues like delay in production is necessary.

C. Conclusion:
-The data revealed that all the product categories had a positive increase in the amount of total revenue generated over the years with the exception of the shirt and socks products which had a significant decline in revenue generation in 2024. This suggests the need for tactical assessment of market conditions and  implementing the strategies suggested so as to improve Sales and grow revenue.
